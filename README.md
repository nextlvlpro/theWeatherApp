This is a simple Weather App That tells you the weather of city you type in search box.  
I have Used Open Weather API for Fetching Weather details. 
Please use Your Own API key From Open Weather, Do not use my API Key or It will be Over Limit. 
The fetch request is in function getWeather().  
The intoEnd() function controls the starting Animation.  
The Call Weather Function Controls the animation after you get into app and also calls the getWeather() function.
